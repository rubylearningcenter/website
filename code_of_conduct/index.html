      <h1 id="rules-and-code-of-conduct">Rules and Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>Our Code of Conduct is based upon the <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/">Contributor Covenant v2.1</a>. For additional rules, enforcement policies, and other information not present below reference the above link, or contact one of the Staff members through any of the means listed below.</p>

<p>It is summarized on the Discord community as such:</p>

<h2 id="-do-this">✅ Do This</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Demonstrate empathy and kindness towards other people</li>
  <li>Be respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences</li>
  <li>Give and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li>
  <li>Accept responsibility and apologize to those affected by mistakes, and learn from the experience</li>
  <li>Focus on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-dont-do-this">🛑 Don’t Do This</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Engage in the use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind</li>
  <li>Engage in trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
  <li>Engage in public or private harassment</li>
  <li>Publish others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission</li>
  <li>Engage in other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-external-presence">🌐 External Presence</h2>

<p>In severe cases of conduct in other forums outside of the Ruby Learning Center moderation action can and will be taken to ensure the safety of the community, and to remove potentially harmful members.</p>

<p>Only in the most extreme of cases will immediate and irrevocable bans be the first action taken. All other concerning matters will be addressed with the member in question through our enforcement guidelines in line with the level of potential community impact.</p>

<h2 id="-reporting-incidents">🗣 Reporting Incidents</h2>
